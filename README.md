Welcome to my dotfiles repository! This collection includes configuration files for a variety of window managers, text editors, and shells — all tailored for performance, customization, and a streamlined workflow.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use these dotfiles:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lukazu25/dotfiles.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the desired directory (e.g., DWM, NEOVIM) and follow any included setup instructions.
3. Backup your existing config files before applying these.


### 📌 Notes

- These configurations are intended for personal use but can serve as a great starting point or reference for others.

- Feel free to fork or adapt them to suit your needs.
